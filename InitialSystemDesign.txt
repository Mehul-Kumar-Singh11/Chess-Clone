Real-Time Multiplayer Game - System Design

1. Overview
This system is designed for real-time interaction between two players in a multiplayer game using WebSockets. WebSockets are chosen for their ability to provide continuous, two-way communication, making it ideal for real-time gaming where players interact with each other and the server frequently.

1. Communication with WebSockets
WebSockets are used for real-time communication between the players and the server.
Unlike HTTP, WebSockets allow for persistent connections, enabling fast and continuous exchanges of data (like player moves, game state updates, etc.).
Each player (browser) connects to the server through a WebSocket, ensuring real-time interaction without the need to continuously make HTTP requests.

2. Game Storage & Management
The system supports multiple games running simultaneously. Each game is stored with its own set of details, such as the players, state, and moves made.
Games are stored in-memory in a dictionary-like structure:

Games = {
    "game1": {
        "participant1": "playerA",
        "participant2": "playerB",
        "state": "in-progress",  # game state: waiting, in-progress, finished
        "moves": ["move1", "move2"],
        "startTime": "2024-11-20T12:00:00Z"
    }
}
When a player joins, their details are stored, and the game state is updated.

3. Limitations of current design: 
Recovery: If the server crashes, all in-memory game data will be lost. A more persistent storage solution is needed for recovery.
Scalability: As more games are played, the server may struggle to handle the growing number of active WebSocket connections and game states.

4. Architecture Overview
WebSocket Server: Manages game logic and player communication.
Game State Storage: Stores game details (participants, state, moves) in-memory.
Real-Time Communication: Players interact via WebSockets, receiving and sending updates instantly.

Client (Player A) <-> WebSocket Server <-> Client (Player B)
                     |
                     |-- Game State (In-memory)
